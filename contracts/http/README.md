# HTTP contracts (full-Rust migration M0)

- `routes.toml`: every `/api/` path the web client (noevia-web `src/`, tests excluded, at the
  commit in `web.ref`) names, with the server that owns it. All `owner = "node"` until a Rust
  slice takes a route over. CI job `routes-check` fails when the client names a path missing here
  (`tools/contracts/routes_check.py`); paths are matched by shape, so `{id}` and `{chatId}` are the
  same parameter. Methods are not listed yet.
- `corpus/`: a synthetic recorded corpus. `exchanges/NNNNNN-METHOD-path.json` are request/response
  pairs written by noevia-core's opt-in recorder (`NOEVIA_CONTRACT_RECORD`,
  `server/contract-record.cjs`) while `tools/contract-corpus/generate.cjs` drove a server on a
  throwaway data dir with a mock model and Diary. Secrets are `<secret:N>`, ids `<id:N>`,
  timestamps `<ts>`; the same value has the same placeholder throughout. `manifest.json` names the
  inputs a replay must supply (the setup code file, the synthetic passwords). Refresh it with
  `tools/contracts/refresh-corpus.sh <noevia-core run id>`.

- `core.ref`: the noevia-core commit the CI job `corpus-replay-node` boots to prove the corpus
  replays clean against Node.

Replay against Node booted the way the corpus was recorded (noevia-core
`tools/contract-corpus/serve.cjs`: the same mock model and Diary, outbound connections refused,
`UI_DATA_DIR` = a fresh copy of the seed):

```sh
mkdir -p "$PWD/target/empty-seed"
cargo run -p replay -- run --corpus contracts/http/corpus --base http://127.0.0.1:18021 \
  --seed "$PWD/target/empty-seed" \
  --server-cmd "exec node <noevia-core>/tools/contract-corpus/serve.cjs" \
  --state-out target/node-state.json
cargo run -p replay -- coverage --corpus contracts/http/corpus --routes contracts/http/routes.toml
```

A Rust server is replayed the same way with its own `--server-cmd` (it must answer the same mock
model and Diary), and `--expect-state target/node-state.json` compares the data dirs it leaves.
